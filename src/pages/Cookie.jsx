              <p>
                Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your device’s memory. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your device, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using our services.</p>

              <h4>Are there different types of cookies?</h4>
              <p>
                First-party and third-party cookies</p>
              <p>There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are placed on your device directly by us. For example, we use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browser’s language preferences and to better understand your use of our website. Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our partners and service providers. You can learn more about these partners and service providers through our website and in-app consent management tools. For details on these tools, see “How can you control cookies?” below.</p>
              <h4>Session and persistent cookies</h4>
              <p>
                There are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies only last until you close your browser. We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our website during one single browser session and to help you to use our website more efficiently. Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan and last beyond the current session. These types of cookies can be used to help you quickly sign-in to our website again, for analytical purposes and for other reasons as described below.</p>
              <h4>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons and SDKs?</h4>
              <p>Other technologies such as web beacons (also called pixel, tags or clear gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs) are used for similar purposes as cookies. Web beacons are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our service or opened an e-mail that we have sent them. Tracking URLs are custom generated links that help us understand where the traffic to our webpages comes from. SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web beacons.</p>
              <h6>For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as “cookies” in this Cookie Policy.</h6>
              <h4>What do we use cookies for?</h4>

            <p>No Obligation to Pre-Screen Content.</p>
            <p>Some web browsers provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. The procedure for managing cookies is slightly different for each internet browser. You can check the specific steps in your particular browser help menu.</p>

For more information on this, you can visit the following sites: Digital Advertising Alliance; Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance; Appchoices (apps only).</p>
            <p>Opting out does not mean that you will not see advertising - it means you won’t see personalized advertising from the companies that participate in the opt-out programs. Also, if you delete cookies on your device after you opt-out, you will need to opt-out again.</p>
