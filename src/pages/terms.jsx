                <p>Welcome to CITAS Terms and Conditions of Use (these "Terms"). This is a contract between

              <h4>10. PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT</h4>
              <p>If you believe any content on Citas infringes the copyright in a work that you own, please
                submit a notification alleging such infringement (“DMCA Takedown Notice”) to Citas
                Copyright Agent. The Takedown Notice must include the following:</p>
              <p>•	A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
                exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</p>

              <p>A statement that, under penalty of perjury, the information in the notification is accurate and
                you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly
                infringed.</p>
              <h4>11.THIRD PARTY APP STORE</h4>
              <p>The following additional terms and conditions apply to you if you download the App from a
                Third Party Store. To the extent that the other terms and conditions of these Terms are less
                restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of this Section, the more
                restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this Section will apply, but solely with respect
                to the App and the Third Party Store. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
              <p>1.These Terms are concluded solely between you and the Citas and not with the providers of
                the Third Party Store, and the Citas (and not the Third Party Store providers) is solely
                responsible for the App and the content thereof. To the extent that these Terms provide for
                usage rules for the App which are less restrictive or in conflict with the applicable terms of
                service of the Third Party Store from which you obtain the App, the more restrictive or
                conflicting term of the Third Party Store will take precedence and will apply.</p>
              <p>2.The Third Party Store provider has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance
                and support services with respect to the App. Citas is solely responsible for any product
                warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed. The
                Third Party Store provider will have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the
                App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any
                failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of the Citas.</p>
              <p>3.The Citas, not the Third Party Store provider, is responsible for addressing any claims you
                or any third party may have relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App,
                including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to
                conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer
                protection or similar legislation; and/or (iv) intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
              <p>4.The Third Party Store provider and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these
                Terms, and, upon your acceptance of these Terms, the Third Party Store provider from
                whom you obtained the App will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the
                right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.</p>
              <p>In the event of a conflict between a Third Party Store’s or mobile carrier’s applicable terms
                and conditions and these Terms, the terms and conditions of the Third Party Store or mobile
                carrier shall govern and control. We are not responsible and have no liability whatsoever for
                third-party goods or services you obtain through a Third Party Store or mobile carrier. We
                encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before
                proceeding with any online transaction with any of these third parties.</p>
              <h5>12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h5>
              <p>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”)
                carefully. Unless you opt-out in the manner described in Section 13(10) below, this
                Arbitration Agreement requires you and Citas to resolve disputes by binding arbitration
                instead of in court and limits the manner in which we may seek relief from each other.</p>
              <p>1.When Does This Arbitration Agreement Apply? This Arbitration Agreement applies to any
                disputes or claims of any kind whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, statute,
                regulation, ordinance, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal or equitable theory)
                between you and the Citas arising out of or relating to the Terms, prior versions of the
                Terms, your use of our App, or any other aspect of your relationship with Citas , including
                claims or disputes arising (but not actually filed in arbitration) before the effective date of
                these Terms. It requires that, and by entering into these Terms you and Citas agree, that
                such disputes or claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except
                that (i) you or Citas may assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims qualify;
                and (ii) you or Citas may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or misuse of
                intellectual property rights.</p>
              <p>2.Notice of Dispute and Informal Resolution. Before beginning the arbitration process, you
                and Citas agree to first notify one another of the dispute in writing at least 60 days in
                advance of initiating an arbitration. Notice to Citas must be sent by letter to our registered
                address, and must provide your name, current email address, mailing address, and
                telephone number, as well as the name, email address, and telephone number associated
                with your Citas account (if different from your current information); and describe the nature of
                the claim and the specific relief being sought.</p>
              <p>You and Citas agree to meet and confer, via teleconference or videoconference, in a good
                faith effort to informally resolve any claim or dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement. If
                either party is represented by counsel, that counsel may participate in the informal dispute
                resolution conference. During this process, you may be provided with an offer of judgment. A
                party defending against a claim may serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment
                on specified terms, with the costs then accrued. If the judgment that the offeree finally
                obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the costs
                incurred after the offer was made.</p>
              <p> All offers, promises, conduct, and statements made in the course of the informal dispute
                resolution process by any party, its agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential and
                not admissible for any purpose in any subsequent proceeding, provided that evidence that is
                otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable
                as a result of its use in the informal dispute resolution process. </p>
              <p>The informal dispute resolution conference shall occur within 60 days of receipt of the written notice described above, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon. If, after participating in that conference, the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the claimant may commence an arbitration in accordance with this Agreement. Completion of this informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration. Failure to do so is a breach of this Agreement, and no demand for arbitration shall be valid unless such written notice is provided and good faith discussions have been conducted.</p>
              <p>
                The informal dispute resolution conference shall occur within 60 days of receipt of the written
                notice described above unless an extension is mutually agreed upon. If, after participating in
                that conference, the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the claimant may commence
                an arbitration in accordance with this Agreement. Completion of this informal dispute
                resolution is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration. Failure to do so is a

                notice is provided and good faith discussions have been conducted.</p>

              <p>Any statute of limitations will be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute
                resolution process described in this section.</p>
              <p>3. How Do You Start The Arbitration Process? If you and Citas are unable to resolve the
                dispute within 60 days, either party may proceed to file a claim for arbitration. To begin the
                arbitration process, you or Citas must submit a notice by certified mail of the claim with an
                individualized arbitration demand. To be valid, the demand must contain the name of the
                claiming party (you or Citas), your or Citas mailing address, the email address or phone
                number associated with your Citas account (if applicable), and a detailed description of the
                dispute and the relief sought. Notice to Citas must be submitted to our registered agent:
                B-25 first floor sector-1 Noida.</p>
              <p>4. What Are The Rules Of Arbitration? The ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT
                (AACA) 1996, governs this Arbitration Agreement and applies to the interpretation and
                enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. If the AACA is found to not apply to any issue
                regarding the interpretation or enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement, that issue shall be
                determined by Indian law, notwithstanding choice-of-law principles. The applicable arbitration
                provider depends on where you live. If you live in California, the arbitration will be
                administered by ADR Services, Inc. under its most current arbitration rules and procedures,
                {/* available at <a>https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules/.</a><br></br> If you live outside of */}
                California, the arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation under its
                most current Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at
                <a>https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms</a>, <br></br>or under its most current Supplemental
                Rules for Mass Arbitrations, as applicable, available at
                {/* <a>https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2021/12/SupplementalRules12.22.21.pdf.</a> If the */}
                applicable arbitration provider is not available to arbitrate, including because it is not able to
                administer the arbitration(s) consistent with the rules, procedures, and terms of this
                Arbitration Agreement, including those described in Section 13(8) (Mass Filings), the parties
                will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the parties cannot agree on an appropriate
                alternative arbitration provider, then the parties will ask a court of competent jurisdiction to
                appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5 that is able to administer the arbitration(s)
                consistent with the rules, procedures, and terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This
                Arbitration Agreement will govern to the extent it conflicts with the arbitration provider’s rules.</p>

              <p>The initiating party must pay all filing fees for the arbitration. Your and Citas’s responsibility
                to pay other administrative and arbitrator costs will be as set forth in the applicable
                arbitration provider’s rules, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. If a
                claim is determined to be frivolous, the claimant is responsible for reimbursing the
                respondent for its portion of all such administrative, hearing, and/or other fees incurred as a
                result of the frivolous claim.</p>

                5. What Can The Arbitrator Decide? The arbitrator has the exclusive authority to resolve any
                and all threshold arbitrability issues, including whether this Arbitration Agreement is
                applicable, enforceable, or unconscionable. Courts, however, shall have the exclusive
                authority to determine (i) whether any provision of this Arbitration Agreement should be
                severed and the consequences of said severance, (ii) the enforceability of any or all of the
                mass arbitration procedures set forth in Section 13(8), (iii) whether you have complied with
                conditions precedent to arbitration, and (iv) whether an arbitration provider is available to
                hear the arbitration(s) under Section 13(4). The arbitrator will have the authority to grant
                motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will have the authority to award
                monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available in an individual
                under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms (including the Arbitration
                Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing
                the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation
                of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief that a judge
                in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and
                us.</p>
              <p>6. No Jury Trials. By agreeing to arbitration, YOU AND Citas ARE EACH AGREEING TO
                WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL. Instead, you and Citas are electing that all
                claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except
                as described in Section 13(1) above. An arbitrator can award the same damages and relief
                as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or
                jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>

              <p>7. One At A Time. All claims and disputes within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement
                MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR
                COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND YOU AND Citas GIVE UP YOUR RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN
                A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. However, this shall not
                preclude the use of bellwether arbitrations, global mediation, or batch arbitrations as
                described in Section 13(8) below, nor preclude the application of the arbitration provider’s
                fee schedules for mass arbitrations, as applicable. Only relief that would be permitted in an
                individual lawsuit is available, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be
                arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other customer or user, except as provided in
                Section 13(8) below, nor shall this preclude application of the arbitration provider’s fee
                schedules for mass arbitrations, as applicable. The arbitration proceeding will not be
                consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties , except as
                provided in Section 13(8) below, nor shall this preclude application of the arbitration
                provider’s fee schedules for mass arbitrations, as applicable.</p>

              <p>8. Mass Filings. If, at any time, 30 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted
                against Citas or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, or if Citas
                Group asserts 30 or more similar demands for arbitration or counterclaims against
                similarly-situated parties, within a period of 60 days or otherwise close in proximity (“Mass
                Filing”), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply:

              <p>1. Mass Filings. If, at any time, 30 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted
                against Citas or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, or if Citas
                Group asserts 30 or more similar demands for arbitration or counterclaims against
                similarly-situated parties, within a period of 60 days or otherwise close in proximity (“Mass
                Filing”), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply:
                1.Acknowledgment of Mass Filing protocols. If you or Citas Group, or your or our counsel,
                files a demand for arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above,
                then you and we agree that the demand for arbitration shall be subject to the additional
                protocols set forth in this Mass Filings subsection. If the parties disagree as to whether a
                series of filings fits within the definition of Mass Filing above, the arbitration provider shall
                resolve the disagreement. You and we also acknowledge that the adjudication of the dispute
                may be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time of
                filing of the demand for arbitration, and pending resolution of the bellwether proceedings.</p>
              <p>2. Bellwether Arbitrations. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration
                administrators where there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or
                related parties. The parties shall select ten individual arbitration claims (five per side),
                designated the “Initial Test Cases,” to proceed to arbitration. Only the Initial Test Cases shall
                be filed with the arbitrator. All other claims shall be held in abeyance. This means that the
                filing fees will be paid only for the Initial Test Cases; for all other demands for arbitration in a
                Mass Filing, the filing fees (together with any arbitrator consideration of the other demands)
                will be in abeyance, and neither You nor Citas will be required to pay any such filing fees.
                You and Citas Group also agree that neither you nor we shall be deemed to be in breach of
                this Arbitration Agreement for failure to pay any such filing fees, and that neither you nor we
                shall be entitled to any contractual, statutory, or other remedies, damages, or sanctions of
                any kind for failure to pay any such filing fees. If, pursuant to this subsection, a party files
                non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration
                provider shall hold those demands in abeyance and not refer them to the arbitrator pending
                resolution of the Initial Test Cases. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the
                schedule is extended, the arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within
                120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.</p>
              <p>Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance and not refer them to the arbitrator pending resolution of the Initial Test Cases. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.</p>
              <p>3. Global Mediation. Following the resolution of the Initial Test Cases, the parties agree to
                engage in a global mediation of all the remaining individual arbitration claims comprising the
                Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”), deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Initial Test
                Cases until the Initial Test Cases and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded. After
                the final awards are provided to the mediator in the Initial Test Cases, the mediator and the
                parties shall have 90 days to agree upon a substantive methodology and make an offer to
                resolve the outstanding cases. If the Parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims
                during the Global Mediation, the Parties may choose to opt out of the arbitration process and
                proceed in court with the remaining claims. Notice of the opt-out shall be provided in writing
                within 60 days of the close of the Global Mediation. Absent notice of an opt-out, the
                arbitrations may then be filed and administered by the arbitration provider pursuant to this
                Agreement’s Batch Arbitration provision below and the arbitrator’s fee schedule for mass
                filings as described in Subsection 13(7) above, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise
                in writing. You and we also acknowledge that any applicable statute of limitations shall be
                tolled pending resolution of the global mediation process.</p>
              <p>4. Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations,
                you and Citas Group agree that in the event a Mass Filing is not resolved by the Bellwether
                Arbitration and Global Mediation processes described above, the arbitration provider will (1)
                administer the remaining arbitration demands in batches of 100 demands per batch; (2)
                appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a
                single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per
                batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the
                arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”). If the arbitration provider will not
                administer the Batch Arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side
                per batch, then the arbitration provider’s mass arbitration fee schedule shall apply.</p>
              <p>Enforcement of Subsection. A Court of competent jurisdiction located in a venue allowed
                under Section 17 of the Terms and Conditions shall have the power to enforce this
                subsection</p>
              <p>9. Offer of Judgment. At least 14 days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, any
                party may serve an offer in writing upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms.
                If the offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to
                obtain a favorable award, the other party shall not recover any post-offer costs to which they
                otherwise would be entitled and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer.</p>
              <p>10. Opt-Out. Updates to Citas Terms do not provide a new opportunity for you to opt out of
                arbitration if you previously agreed to a prior version of Citas Terms containing an arbitration
                provision and did not validly opt out of arbitration.</p>
              <p>Previous or existing users. Users who previously agreed to arbitrate may reject this updated
                Arbitration Agreement by following the opt-out method below, but such users will still be
                bound by the most recent prior version of the Arbitration Agreement and will otherwise be
                bound by these Terms. Previous or existing users who do not opt out of this updated
                Arbitration Agreement will be bound by this Arbitration Agreement and it shall apply to all
                disputes between such users and Citas , including those arising (but not actually filed in
                arbitration) before the effective date of these Terms. Arbitration demands that have already
                been actually filed with an arbitration provider before the effective date of this Arbitration
                Agreement and in compliance with a prior version of this Arbitration Agreement are subject
                to the prior version’s terms.</p>
              <p>Method and impact of opting out. Subject to the above, you may opt out of this Arbitration
                Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out within 31 days after first
                becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name, your
                Citas username (if any), the email address and/or phone number you used to set up your
                Citas account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of
                this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of the
                Terms and any other agreements between you and Citas will continue to apply to you.
                Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements
                that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p>
              <p>11. Severability. Except as provided in subsection 13(7), if any part or parts of this Arbitration
                Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or
                parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the
                Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If a court decides that any of the
                provisions in the Arbitration Agreement above is invalid or unenforceable because it would
                prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any
                dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from
                arbitration and may be litigated in court. All other disputes subject to arbitration under the
                terms of the Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms.</p>
              <p>Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If a court decides that any of the provisions in the Arbitration Agreement above is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in court. All other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of the Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms.</p>
              <p>
                12. Survival of Agreement. The terms of this Arbitration Agreement will continue, even after
                your relationship with citas has ended. </p>
              <h4>13. USE OF THIRD PARTY INTEGRATIONS</h4>
              <p>If you use the Snap Lenses feature offered in our App or any other AR features provided by
                Snap similar to Snap Lenses, you will be subject to the Snap Inc. Terms of Service, which
                contain an arbitration clause including a waiver of any right to participate in a class-action
                lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. If you do not agree to be subject to the Snap Inc. Terms of
                Service, you should not use the Snap-provided AR camera features within our App.</p>

                discontinue your Account; (d) discontinue your subscription(s) without refund; (e) notify
                and/or send your User Content to and/or fully cooperate with the proper law enforcement
                authorities for further action; and/or (f) pursue to any other action which Citas Group deems
                to be appropriate. You agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in Citas Group’s
                sole discretion and that Citas Group shall not be liable to you or any third party for any
                termination of your Account.</p>

                these Terms which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of these Terms,
                including, without limitation, the Arbitration Agreement, ownership provisions, warranty
                disclaimers and limitation of liability. Your information will be maintained and deleted in
