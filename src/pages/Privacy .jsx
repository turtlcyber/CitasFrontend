              </p>

              <h4>Profile Information</h4>

              <p>We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the
                information you disclose about yourself. We also do not recommend that you put email
                addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses,
                national identity numbers, driver’s license details, and other sensitive information that is
                open to abuse and misuse on your profile.</p>
              <p>When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function to communicate
                with other Users, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. Please
                see Section 4 below for more information on who can access what you post on CITAS.</p>
              <h6>Profile Verification Information (Including Biometric Information)</h6>
              <p>For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we
                require Users to verify their accounts and might ask for your phone number and, in some
                instances, we might also ask that you carry out photo verification. We want to make sure you
                are not a robot! We also want to avoid fake CITAS accounts being created which can be
                used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the CITAS network and spoil
                things for everyone. This verification might be required by us for the prevention of fraud. You
                can also verify your photo on a voluntary basis (to add the blue ‘verified’ badge to your
                profile).</p>

              <p>If you choose to verify your profile photo, we will scan each photo that you submit. The scan
                may include the use of facial recognition technology so that we can compare the photo you
                submit to your profile photo, to help ensure that you are who you say you are. We do not add
                the verification photos to your profile. We retain the scans so that we can verify you in the
                future and for our record-keeping purposes until we no longer need them for such purposes
                or for 180 days after your last interaction with us, whichever occurs first. After the applicable
                retention period expires, we take commercially reasonable steps to permanently and
                securely delete the scans from our systems.</p>
              <h4>Purchases Information</h4>
              <p>If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process your payment
                information and retain this securely for the prevention of fraud and for audit/tax purposes.</p>
              <p>Please note that if your account is blocked for any reason, any account(s) that you have on
                other CITAS platforms/applications, may also be blocked as part of our anti-spam and
                anti-fraud procedures.</p>
              <h6>Geolocation Information</h6>
              <p>If you have given CITAS access to your location in your device settings, when you use your
                cell, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location information
                about your longitude and latitude and may save your device’s coordinates to offer certain
                features to you. This information helps us identify your physical location and we use it to
                personalize the App and make it easier for you to interact with other Users, by enabling the
                general locality information to be displayed to Users seeing your profile and showing you the
                profiles of other Users who are near you.</p>
              <p>If you have given CITAS access to your location, but wish to turn this off, you can do so by
                the following methods:</p>
              <p>Android — settings, location, Citas, permissions, location
                iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, Citas
              </p>
              <h3>Device and Photos Information</h3>
              <p>We may collect information about your device when you use the App including the unique
                device identifier, device model, and operating system, for a number of purposes, as set out
                in this policy. In addition, if you permit us to do so, the App may access your device’s
                address book solely in order to add someone to your contacts.</p>
              <p>We also collect data about your photos, such as which are the photos that users spend time
                on or which are the photos that have the best lighting, etc. We may use that data to
                rearrange your profile photos aiming to position them in a way that is favorable to you. You
                may opt out of this feature through our app settings.</p>

              </h3>
              <p>We may keep track of how you interact with links available on Citas including third-party
                services by redirecting clicks or through other means. We may share aggregate click
                statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p><h3>Messages</h3>
              <p>We review the content of messages sent in the App to identify topics, sentiments, and trends
                across our Users. We will take steps to remove personally identifying information from such
                messages, prior to reviewing them. We will not share the content of User messages or
                information we derive from them with any third party.</p>

                address and may track your IP address, as well as the information you send to us to help
                resolve your query. We will keep records of our communications with you, including any
                complaints that we receive from you about other Users (and from other Users about you) for
                10 years after the deletion of your account.</p>

              <h3>Our Matching Algorithms</h3>
              <p>CITAS's mission is to create kind and equitable relationships. We have developed matching
                algorithms to predict your compatibility with other users so we can show you people we think
                are a good match for you. We use different indications based on users’ profiles on our app
                (for example, how you swipe or whether you match with someone). We use these indications
                to recommend the most relevant profiles to everyone to maximize everyone’s chances of
                finding meaningful connections on our apps. Our matching algorithms are based on a range
                of factors and use machine learning to rank profiles for you to maximize your chance of
                finding compatible matches. We use the following data about you and other users to predict
                your compatibility with others and generate profile recommendations: the information you
                provide us about yourself in your profile such as age, distance or gender so we can show
                you people who are appropriate and are more likely to like you back; information about how
                you interact with our app to suggest to you people who are active and available to meet new
                people; and your device coordinates, which are necessary to understand your proximity to
                other members. The legal basis for processing profile and proximity information is that this is
                necessary for the provision of our contractual services to you pursuant to Article 6(1)(b)
                GDPR. Where we process information about your app activity, this is based on our legitimate
                interests pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, and specifically our legitimate interest in
                generating more personalized and relevant recommendations for whom you can match
                within our App. Where you have included sensitive information in your profile, such as
                information about your beliefs, the processing of this information is based on your voluntary
                and explicit consent.</p>

              <h3>Moderation Practices</h3>
              <p>We use a combination of automated systems and a team of moderators to monitor and
                review accounts (including photos and any other information uploaded onto user profiles)
                and messages for content that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. If an
                account or message meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of
                Use are likely to have been breached, the relevant account will be subject to a warning, and
                the user’s access restricted and/or blocked. Affected Users can contact Citas to contest the
                decision.</p>
              <p>If you post anything that is inconsistent with our Terms and Conditions of Use, we reserve
                the right to terminate or restrict access to your Account.</p>
              <h3>Lawful Basis</h3>
              <p>Under Indian data protection laws, we are required to tell you our lawful basis for using your
                data and we have set this out in the table below. Where the legal basis is consent, you can
                withdraw consent at any time. Where the legal basis is legitimate interests, you have a right
                to object to our use of your data. We explain in the relevant sections of this Policy how you
                can withdraw consent or opt out of certain data uses (where applicable).</p>

                MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DISCLOSURES</h3>
              <p></p>
              <h3>Service Providers</h3>
              <p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us
                (“Service Providers”). The suppliers with which Citas shares User personal data vary
                depending on a variety of factors, such as which of our App, Sites and services a User
                engages with. For example, to provide our services to Users, we typically use the following
                suppliers:</p>
              <p>Billing services – to allow customers to purchase paid features of our App (for example,
                Google Play)</p>
              <p>Authentication services – to allow customers to authenticate their account (for example,
                Firebase)</p>
              <p>Social media providers – to allow customers to create/connect their Citas account with their
                account(s) on such platforms (for example Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, or Spotify)
                Product improvement and market research – we may use third-party platforms (such as
                Typeform) and agencies (such as Kantar) to carry out customer surveys and market
                research to improve our products and services.</p>
              <p>IT services – We carry out due diligence on all Service Providers we engage to ensure they
                have adequate data protection and information security measures in place and only provide
                them with the personal data necessary to the service they are providing. Measures are taken
                to ensure that the data shared is non-attributable to the greatest extent possible and our
                suppliers are also subject to extensive obligations under our contractual arrangements,
                including strict data retention limits.</p>

              <h3>Marketing Services Providers</h3>
              <p>We partner with providers of marketing services (such as Facebook for example) (‘Marketing
                Services Providers’) to help us market and advertise our App and services on third-party
                websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. For
                example:</p>
              <p>To exclude you from advertising campaigns aimed at finding new users, if you already have a
                Citas account;</p>

              <p>To show Citas adverts to users who have visited the Citas App/Sites but haven’t yet created
                a Citas account;</p>
              <p>We share a limited amount of your personal data with these Marketing Services Providers, such as:
              </p>
              <p>to create an audience for our advertisements of other potential users who have similar
                characteristics to you based on the information the Marketing Service Providers hold about
                you (also known as a Lookalike Audience); or<br></br>
                To include you in a ‘custom audience’ that will receive Citas advertising content (a custom
                audience is essentially a list of people who we think are most likely to be interested in a
                particular advertisement).</p>
              <p>We share a limited amount of your personal data with these Marketing Services Providers,
                such as:</p>
              <p>the advertising identifier associated with your device (this is a random number assigned by
                your mobile device manufacturer (for example Apple or Google) to your device to help
                advertisers (including the manufacturer) know when an ad has been viewed or clicked in an
                app, and when an ad causes a ‘conversion’ (for example, downloading the app advertised to
                you))</p>
              <p>your estimated location (based on your IP address)</p>
              <h3>Age and Gender</h3>
              <p>Data about your visit to our Sites or App and action taken on those (for example if you
                downloaded our App, created an account with our App, or details of any purchases made on
                Site or in App)</p>
              <p>A hashed* version of your email address (to create ‘custom audiences’).</p>
              <p>*Hashing is a way of encrypting information by turning it into a combination of random
                numbers and letters - this code cannot be traced back to the email address. When hashed
                email addresses are sent to a Marketing Service Provider, they’re then matched against the
                Provider’s own existing list of their own users’ hashed information and our ads are served to
                those of our users who have successfully been matched with the Provider’s. Matched and
                unmatched hashes are then deleted by the Provider.</p>


              <p>For more information about how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, including
                how you can set and manage your preferences with regard to such technologies, please see
                our Cookie Policy.</p>
              <p>In some cases, these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own
                purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this
                to inform advertising-related services provided to other clients.</p>

              <h3>4. WHAT OTHERS MAY SEE ABOUT YOU.
              </h3>
              <p>We think our Users are awesome, and we want you to share how awesome you are with the
                world, so we have built certain features to enable this. Our App is designed to make it easier
                for you to connect with other Users and to interact with them.</p>
              <p>When using the Citas app, you should assume that anything you post or submit on the App
                may be publicly viewable and accessible, both by Users and non-users of the App. We want
                our Users to be careful about posting information that may eventually be made public.</p>
              <p>Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such as your
                religious denomination and health details. You may also choose to add sensitive information
                about yourself when you add certain Citas badges to your profile, such as your religion and
                political leanings. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create
                your profile, including your sexual preferences, there is no requirement to do so. Please
                remember that photographs that you post on Citas may reveal information about yourself as
                well. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself,
                including through the addition of badges to your profile, you are explicitly consenting to our
                processing of this information and making it public to other Users.</p>
              <p>Your Citas profile and other information you make available via the App, including certain
                information added to your profile through third-party accounts (such as Facebook, Instagram
                or Spotify – see section 7 of this Privacy Policy for more information about this) may be
                viewed and shared by Users with individuals who may or may not be users of the App. For
                example, a User may recommend you as a match to his or her Facebook friend(s) by taking
                a screenshot of your profile picture and sharing it, regardless of whether such friend(s) is
                also a User of the App.</p>
              <p>Please also note that in certain countries (currently, South Korea only), Users are provided
                with functionality enabling them to download a copy of their conversation history (as this is
                required by local laws) and that Citas has no control over how users may then publish or use
                that information.</p>
              <p>If you log in to or access the App through your Facebook account or another third-party
                account on a device that you share with others, remember to log out of the App and the
                relevant third-party account when you leave the device in order to prevent other users from
                accessing your Citas account.</p>
              <h3>5. OUR POLICY TOWARDS AGE.</h3>
              <p>Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you have to be at least
                18 years old to use Citas.</p>
              <p>Citas does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors, or
                anyone under the age of 18. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the
                age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will take
                steps to terminate that person’s registration.</p>
              <h3>6. SECURITY.</h3>
              <p>Here at Citas, we pride ourselves on taking all appropriate security measures to help protect
                your information against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, or disclosure. We use
                reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information
                such as secured servers using firewalls.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, no website or Internet transmission is ever completely 100% secure and even
                we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will
                never occur, but here are some handy tips to help keep your data secure:</p>
              <p>Please make sure you log out of your Account after use as you never know who may
                stumble onto your Account!<br></br>Please don’t share the password you use to access your Citas Account with anyone else!
                Change your password periodically.</p>
              <p>
                If you ever think someone has had access to your password or Account, please follow the
                steps set out here. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being
                transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.

              <h3>7. LINKING OTHER ACCOUNTS TO Citas.</h3>
              <p>Using your social media details to sign in to Citas
                When you sign in to our App using your Facebook account, you give permission to
                Facebook to share with us your name and profile picture. Unless you opt out, you also give
                permission to Facebook to share with us your email address (if there is one associated with
                your Facebook account), date of birth, profile photos, gender, Page likes, and current
                town/city</p>
              <p>If you register or sign in with your Apple ID, you give Apple permission to share your Apple
                login, a name (that can be edited by you), and an email (you can choose to hide your email
                and Apple will create a random email address so your personal email can stay private). This
                email address will be linked to your Citas account and will be used to retrieve your Citas
                account.</p>
              <p>We will then use this personal data to form your Citas account. If you remove the Citas app
                from your Facebook settings, or from your Apple ID, we will no longer have access to this
                data. However, we will still have the personal data that we received when you first set up
                your Citas account using your Facebook or Apple ID (you must delete your Citas account
                entirely for us to no longer have access to this data).</p>
              <p>Linking social media accounts to your Citas account
                You may link your Citas account with your Instagram, Facebook or Spotify accounts. This
                allows you to share some information from those accounts directly to your citas account (for
                example, Instagram photos, or your top Spotify artists).</p>

              <p>We only receive the limited information that Instagram or Spotify permits to be transferred
                (as detailed by Instagram/Facebook/Spotify and agreed by you when you first connect your
                account from such platforms with your Citas account).</p>
              <p>If you no longer want to link your citas account to your Instagram, Facebook or Spotify

              <p>For Users who are California residents, you have the following rights (in addition to those
                listed at section 10 below) under the California Consumer Privacy Act, and you have the
                right to be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the Act:</p>
              <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you and explain how we
                have collected, used and shared your personal information over the past 12 months.
                You have the right to request that we delete the personal information that we collected from
                you, subject to certain exceptions.</p>
              <p>California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to
                respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices
                related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing
                purposes. If you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code
                section 1798.83, you can write to us at developerturtltech@gmail.com.</p>
              <p>From time to time, as part of a joint promotion with a third party, we may, if you participate in
                such promotion, disclose your contact information to the third party to allow them to market
                their products or services to you. Where this is a condition for participation in a promotion,
                we will always let you know before when you enter the promotion. Please follow the
                instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages.</p>
              <p>In addition, under California law, operators of online services are required to disclose how
                they respond to “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers
                the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer
                over time and across third-party online services, to the extent the operator engages in that
                collection. At this time, we do not track our Users’ personal information over time and across
                third-party online services. This law also requires operators of online services to disclose
                whether third parties may collect personal information about their users’ online activities over
                time and across different online services when the users use the operator’s service. We do
                not knowingly permit third parties to collect personal information about an individual User’s
                online activities over time and across different online services when using the App.</p>

              <h3>12. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION.</h3>
              <p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the legal basis relied upon
                (as set out in Section 2 above) and as permitted by applicable law. Please see “Profile
                Verification Information (Including Biometric Information)” in Section 1, above, to learn about
                our retention policy with respect to biometric information.</p>
              <p>When your Account is deleted, we make sure it is no longer viewable in the App. For up to
                28 days, it is still possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally deleted. After 28
                days, we begin the process of deleting your personal information from our systems, unless:</p>
              <p>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, if you make purchases within the
                App, some personal data may be kept for tax and accounting purposes);
                we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for example, if an account
                is blocked, we keep some account information and a record of the behavior that led to the
                block - this information is retained for evidential purposes in case of queries or legal claims
                concerning the block);</p>
              <p>There is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information
                until it is resolved; or
                the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention
                and enhancing Users’ safety and security (for example, information may need to be kept to
                prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a
                new account).</p>
              <p>Warning: Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your Account, copies
                of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed to the extent such information has
                been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by others. We cannot control this,
                nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third-party applications or websites
                access to your personal information, they may retain such information to the extent permitted
                under their terms of service or privacy policies.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading, we hope we didn’t drone on for too long!
